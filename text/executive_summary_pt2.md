### Analytic Observations
This year we did a deeper dive into understanding how students' response might predict their general sentiment towards College Track. For example, did students who answered unfavorably to our NPS question also answer other questions unfavorably? 


Some questions stood out as being remarkably good indicators of how students evaluated College Track. 

For instance, students were asked the following question, "Because of coaching, I am more self-motivated and have a sense of ownership to accomplish my goals." 

All students, with one exception, who answered that question positively also was classified as a "Promoter" in the NPS question.  



Two other questions that had a strong correlation with how students who evaluated College Track positively were:
- "How excited are you about going to your virtual College Track workshops?"
- "I enjoy collaborating with other College Track students while participating in virtual workshops."

Students who answered positively towards either, or both, of those questions were nearly 40% more likely to be a College Track promoter. 


On the flip side, a few questions were very strong predictors of a student being a College Track detractor. 

Unsuprisingly, the question that was the leading indicator of being a College Track detractor was "When I'm at CT I feel I belong"
