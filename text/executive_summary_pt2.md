### Analytic Observations
This year we did a deeper dive into understanding how students' response might predict their general sentiment towards College Track. For example, did students who answered unfavorably to our NPS question also answer other questions unfavorably? 


Some questions stood out as being remarkably good indicators of how students evaluated College Track. 

For instance, students were asked the following question, "Because of coaching, I am more self-motivated and have a sense of ownership to accomplish my goals." 

Around 80% of students who answered that question positively were also classified as a "Promoter" in the NPS question.  In addition, around 70% of students who answered the question unfavorably were either classified as passive or a detractor.


Two other questions that had a strong correlation with how students who evaluated College Track positively were:
- "How excited are you about going to your virtual College Track workshops?"
- "Iâ€™ve been given flexible options (multiple timings, assignment completion, makeups, etc.) for how to participate with College Track."

Students who answered positively towards either, or both, of those questions were nearly 30% more likely to be a College Track promoter. 

On the flip side, a few questions were strong predictors of a student being a College Track detractor.

The question that was the strongest predictor of a student being a detractor was, "CT helps me better understand that I am in control of my academic performance." Around 70% of students who did not answer that question positively were classified as a detractor. 

Two other questions stood out as strong indicators of a student being a detractor were:

-  "When I'm at CT I feel I belong."
- "My site is run effectively." 
    - For this question, we provided students with examples of what an "effective" site might look like.
