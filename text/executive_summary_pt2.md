### Analytic Observations
This year we did a deeper dive into understanding how students' response might predict their general sentiment towards College Track. For example, did students who answered unfavorably to our NPS question also answer other questions negatively? 


Some questions stood out as being remarkably good indicators of how students evaluated College Track. 

For instance, students were asked the following question, "Because of coaching, I am more self-motivated and have a sense of ownership to accomplish my goals." 

Around 98% of students who answered that question positively were also classified as a "Promoter" in the NPS question.  In addition, around 70% of students who answered the question unfavorably were either classified as passive or a detractor.

Two other questions that had a strong correlation with how students who evaluated College Track positively were:
- "How excited are you about going to your virtual College Track workshops?"
- "Iâ€™ve been given flexible options (multiple timings, assignment completion, makeups, etc.) for how to participate with College Track."

Students who answered positively towards either, or both, of those questions were nearly 30% more likely to be a College Track promoter. 

On the flip side, a few questions were strong predictors of a student being a College Track detractor.

The question that was the strongest predictor of a student being a detractor was, "CT helps me better understand that I am in control of my academic performance." Around 70% of students who did not answer that question positively were classified as a detractor. 

Two other questions that stood out as strong indicators of a student being a detractor were:

-  "When I'm at CT I feel I belong."
- "My site is run effectively."* 

*For this question, we provided students with examples of what an "effective" site might look like.

#### Black Male Students

Among any ethnic and gender combination that College Track serves our black male students had by far the most positive responses to all the questions asked. Overall, they evaluated quesstions positively 71% of the time compared to the next highest grouping (male Latino and male Asian-American) who answered questions favorably 58% of the time.

On each section of the survey, black males responded more positivley than the College Track average of those questions. In particular our black male seniors had very high praise for our programing aimed at seniors, and all our black male students found our student life and coaching to be valuable. 

Like all our students, when asked about virtual programming our black male students responded comparably less favorably although they were still more positive than the College Track average.

Across every question asked, there was not a single question this group of students had a notably less favorable outlook on than the College Track average, and on roughly 14% of questions they had a notably higher positivity rate than their peers. 

#### AAPI Students

Due to the increased number of hate crimes targeting Asian Americans we wanted to better understand the ethnic backgrounds of our students identifying as Asian American.

We asked students to self identify their ethnicity from a list of our existing ethnic descriptions in Salesforce but with new options to more accurately describe students of Asian descent - for example East Asian, Southeast Asian, and Filipino.

Overall, around 19% of our students responded to this question and selected an ethnicity that didn't equate to what already existed in Salesforce. The majority of these responses were students who identified as East Asian (90 students) and Southeast Asian (64 students). In addition, 31 students identified themselves as multiracial when they previously had been identified with only a single ethnicity. 

### Section Highlights
The following section highlights some noteworthy findings on speciifc questions asked. For each of these sections there is a chart that highlights if a specific group of students across College Track was notably above or below the average positive rate for a given question. 

Each chart just highlights the two questions with the largest positive and negative gap for a given group of questions. For this we only focused on notable groups of students across all College Track. To see differences among sites you can use the Data Studio dashboard. 


#### CT Site and Safety
Overall % of Questions Marked Positive: 77%

Site With Highest Positive Rate: Boyle Heights

{{ct_site_plot}}

As will come up multiple times, males tend to have a more favorable outlook on a number of questions asked. In this example, specifically male, Asian-Americans had a much higher positivity rate (95%) when asked about prioritizing CT attendance compared to the College Track average of 81%. 

Also as already noted, the Class of 2024 often has a more negative response on a number of questions, in this case when asked about fiendships developed through College Track. 

Other notable groups of students that had favorable responses to these questions were students from Boyle Heights and The Durant Center (specifically their male students from both sites).

#### Academic Affairs
Overall % of Questions Marked Positive: 64%

Site With Highest Positive Rate: The Durant Center

{{academic_affairs_plot}}

As with the previous section, male, Asian-Americans had notably higher remarks when asked how comfortable they are working with students in study groups. On all the academic affairs questions however The Durant Center stood out as having a particularly positive response as did the Class of 2021. 

Once again, the Class of 2024 did standout as having a less positive outlook when asked about how valuable College Track has been in terms of providing academic resources to the students. Likely, as we will see multiple times, this is largely due to this group of students not having an in-person experience with College Track. In addition to this group of students, our female Asians American students also had a generally less favorable view of College Track's academic supports. 

#### Student Life
Overall % of Questions Marked Positive: 70%

Site With Highest Positive Rate: Denver

{{student_life_plot}}

Once again, males stood out has having a more favorable view on many student life questions, but specifically African American male students had the most favorable response when asked about finding their life purpose. Ward 8, also had notably high responses among all their students, but speficially their female students. 

When asked the same question, our female Asian American students did have a notably less positive response, with only 50% of these students responding favorably. 

#### College Prep
Overall % of Questions Marked Positive: 69%

Site With Highest Positive Rate: The Durant Center

{{college_prep_plot}}

Unsurprisingly, and certainly a good thing, our Class of 2021 students had the highest praise for our College Prep programming, specifically the support we have provided around financing college. New Orleans students, specifically their males and Boyle Heights students, specifically their females, also had high praise for these services. Among our non-mature sites, Ward 8 stood out as having success in this area among their female students. 

Overall, our Class of 2024 students had the lowest views on these questions, but our female Asian-Americans also had less favorable remarks when specifically asked about opportunities to attend college fairs or meet college representatives. 


#### Coaching 
Overall % of Questions Marked Positive: 69%

Site With Highest Positive Rate: The Durant Center
{{coaching_plot}}

For coaching, students had the most diverging views on the same question. As we have seen before, our Class of 2021 students is viewing many services , in this case coaching, more favorably while our Class of 2024 students has yet to relate to these services. 

Students at The Durant Center and Aurora (specifically Aurora's male students) also had high remarks for many of these questions. 


#### Wellness

Overall % of Questions Marked Positive: 80%

Site With Highest Positive Rate: Watts
{{wellness_plot}}

For wellness, there were no notable College Track wide groups of students who had less favorable views! While our male African American students did have a much higher positivity rate when asked how coaching has impacted their mental health. This trend broadly extended to our male students overall across all ethnicities. 



#### Virtual Programming

Overall % of Questions Marked Positive: 49%

Site With Highest Positive Rate: Crenshaw

{{virtual_programming_plot}}

Due to COVID-19 and the necessity to go virtual, we added some questions around College Track's delivery of virtual programming. In this area, Class of 2024 students did have a more positive outlook and indicated they are more excited to attend virtual programming. Notably our male Afircan Americans also responded more favorably than the College Track average when asked about their ability to stay focused on goals.

Interestingly, students with reasonably good GPAs indicated they haven't been able to do more collaboration among other College Track students. 

#### Seniors

Overall % of Questions Marked Positive: 83%

Site With Highest Positive Rate: Denver

For this section, no group of students stood out as having a notably higher or lower positivity rate compared to the College Track average on each question.


#### Non-Seniors

Overall % of Questions Marked Positive: 66%

Site With Highest Positive Rate: Boyle Heights

For this section, no group of students stood out as having a notably higher or lower positivity rate compared to the College Track average on each question.
