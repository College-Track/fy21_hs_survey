We also built an interactive dashboard to display information on students' thoughts on COVID-19 and returning to College Track. You can find that [here](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/c5dd6e77-2fac-45cf-a760-2ba0501a581d/page/PkIoB).

#### Summary
For the second year, College Track's annual surveys were administered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Last year, our response rate dipped to 70%. This year, we had an improved response rate of 80%, which is closer to our historical average of 80% - 90%.

Our overall NPS score was 52%, a dip from last year's 55%, but still above previous years' metric. This dip was driven by a slight increase in the percent of detractors, from 8% in FY20 to 10% in FY21. Boyle Heights led the way with an NPS score of 69%, edging out The Durant Center who also had a strong score of 67%. San Francisco, Aurora, Oakland, and Watts were the other sites with above a 50% NPS score.

#### General Highlights
Across all of the questions, the following questions were the most positive.

Likewise, across all questions, the following questions were the least positive.

Note, many of the questions with less positive responses were new questions added to understand how students were handling remote education.

A few sites stood out as having particularly positive responses across all their questions. The Durant Center, Boyle Heights, Ward 8, and Denver all had most students answering positively to over 60% of questions asked.*

The Durant Center, in particular, had a notably higher positive response rate than the College Track average.

Across high school classes, the Class of 2021 had the most positive outlook on College Track. These students answered questions favorably over 70% of the time. In contrast, the Class of 2024 only answered around 30% of questions with a positive outlook.
Unsurprisingly, students identified as a "Detractor" - as determined by our NPS question, had notably less positive answers on almost all (87%) of questions asked. Students marked as "Passive" also had a less favorable outlook, but only on around 30% of questions. No other student grouping across all of College Track had a consistently less positive outlook on questions. Males responded positively to over 60% of questions compared to females who only answered favorably 46% of the time.

Among ethnicities served, our African Americans led the way with positive responses on 61% of questions followed by our Latinx students who responded positively to 51% of questions. When looking at the positivity rate by students' current cumulative GPA, the data is a bit more mixed. Students falling into a GPA range of 2.5 - 3.0 had the highest outlook on questions, responding positively to around 58% of questions. Compared to students with less than a 2.5 GPA who responded positively only 44% of the time. All other GPA groupings saw students respond positively to around 50% - 54% of questions.

*A question was marked as having a favorable response if 70% of respondents responded positively. A positive response was determined by a student marking positive responses for a given question - for example, "Strongly Agree" and "Agree."

#### Trends from Previous Years

Since College Track started offering the survey, a number of questions have remained the same and have students answer them more positively or negatively. The following charts break down these trends since FY18 and FY20 (last year). Generally speaking, none of the questions show overly dramatic improvements over either of the time periods.

However, a few questions have seen decreases in positive responses since FY18. Most notably, the question, "I understand where to find and how to apply for scholarships to help pay for college." That has gone from a high near 70% of students answering positively in FY18 to just below 50% in FY21.

Likewise, a similar question, "I understand my options when it comes to paying for college" has seen a decrease from nearly 80% positive response to around 70%.
