We also built an interactive dashboard to display information on students thoughts on COVID-19 and returning to College Track. You can find that [here](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/c5dd6e77-2fac-45cf-a760-2ba0501a581d/page/PkIoB).

#### Summary
For the second year, College Track's annual surveys were administered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Like the previous year, we have seen a diminished ability for staff to reach out and request feedback from students. Last year, our response rate dipped to 70% following the disruptions from COVID-19. This year, however, we did have a notably improved response rate of 80%, which is closer to our historical average of {previous_range}.

Our overall NPS score was {nps_score}, a dip from last year's 55%, but still above previous years' metric. This dip was driven by a slight increase in the percent of detractors, from 8% in FY20 to 10% in FY21. 

Boyle Heights led the way with an NPS score of 69%, edging out The Durant Center who also had a strong score of 67%. San Francisco, Aurora, Oakland, and Watts were the other sites with above a 50% NPS score. 

Of note, Watts had the third highest rate of promoters, with 66% of students responding positively, but also the forth highest rate of detractors with 15% of students responding less favorably.


#### General Highlights
Across all of the questions, the following questions were the most positive*.

Likewise, across all questions, the following questions were the least positive.

{most_negative}

*A question was marked positive if over 70% of students responded positively.

Note, many of the questions with less positive responses were new questions added to understand how students were handling remote education.

A few sites stood out as having particular positive responses across all their questions. Boyle Heights, Ward 8, and The Durant Center all had most students answering positively to over 60% of questions asked.

The Durant Center, in particular, had a notably higher positive response rate than the College Track average on about 23% of all questions asked. 

Across high school classes, the Class of 2021 had the most positive outlook on College Track. These students answered questions favorably just over 70% of the time. In contrast, the Class of 2024 only answered around 30% of question with a positive outlook.

Unsurprisingly, students identified as a "Detractor" - as determined by our NPS question, had notably less positive answers on almost all (87%) of questions asked. Students marked as "Passive" also had a less favorable outlook, but only on around 30% of questions. No other student grouping across all of College Track had a consistently less positive outlook on questions.

Males responded positively to over 60% of questions compared to females who only answered positively 44% of the time.

Our African Americans and Latinx students (of all genders) responded positively to roughly 50% of questions, but notably our African American, male students responded positively to 70% of questions. This was by far our highest positive response rate for any ethnicity/gender combination.

Finally, students with above a 3.25 GPA answered questions over 50% of questions positively, compared to students with below a 2.5 GPA answering only 42% of questions favorably.

#### Trends from Previous Years

Since College Track started offering the survey, a number of questions have remained the same and have students answer them more positively or negatively. The following charts break down these trends since FY18 and FY20 (last year). Generally speaking, none of the questions show overly dramatic improvements over either of the time periods. 

However, a few questions have seen notable decreases in positive responses since FY18. Most notably, is the question, "I understand where to find and how to apply for scholarships to help pay for college." That has gone from a high near 70% of students answering positively in FY18 to just below 50% in FY21.

Likewise, a similar question, "I understand my options when it comes to paying for college" has seen a decrease from nearly 80% positive response to around 70%.
