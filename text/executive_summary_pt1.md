#### Summary
For the second year, College Track's annual surveys were administered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Like the previous year, we have seen a diminished ability for staff to reach out and request feedback from students. Our response rate of 68% this year is similar to the 70% we had last year, both of which are below the previous range of {previous_range}.

Notably, our NPS Score has remained high, with 53%.


#### General Highlights
Across all of the questions, the following questions were the most universally positive.

Likewise, across all questions, the following questions were answered the least positive.

Likewise, a few sites stood out as having particular positive responses across all their questions. Boyle Heights, Ward 8, Denver, and The Durant Center all had a very high positive response rate (over 70%) to most questions. One important note, is that while Denver did have a very positive response, their student count is a bit lower. 

#### Trends from Previous Years

Since College Track started offering the survey, a number of questions have remained the same and have students answer them more positivley or negatively. The following charts break down these trends since FY18 and FY20 (last year). Generally speaking, none of the questions show overly dramatic changes over either of the time periods. Perhaps the most notable exception is the somewhat dramatic decrease in students answering positively to the question, "I understand where to find and how to apply for scholarships to help pay for college." That has gone from a high near 70% in FY18 to just below 50% in FY21.
